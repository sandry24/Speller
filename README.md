# Speller
This exercise is part of Harvard's CS50 course in week 5. The objective of this exercise is to implement a hash table for checking whether each word in a text is present in the dictionary. I have used a common method of hashing strings in competitive programming using precomputation and achieved times close to the author's solution.
Usage: ./speller dictionary text
Author's solution usage: ./speller50 dictionary text
Usage example: ./speller dictionaries/large texts/shakespeare.txt
